# integrate peote-view inside OpenFL

(work in progress)  

Simple integration into [OpenFL](https://github.com/openfl) via RENDER_OPENGL event following [this sample](https://github.com/openfl/openfl-samples-haxe/tree/master/features/display/CustomRendering).  
  
## TODO

- needs little fixing for resize and inside gl-renderloop 
- using OpenFL-Sprites matrix-transformation inside the invoked peote-view
- testing together with default OpenFL-rendering, z-depth and alphachannels
